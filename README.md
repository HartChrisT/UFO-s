# UFO's

### Overview
Purpose: To build a fully dynamic webpage that can sort through UFO data using Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript.

### Results
Navigating to the homepage of the UFO website will bring you to the chart with all the UFO data. To the left of the table, you can sort the data by the criteria listed.

For example, by entering 1/1/2010 into the date filter and pressing enter on your keyboard, you will see the following, all UFO sightings on that date.

You can further the search by adding another filter, entering ca into the state filter will give you this.

### Summary
One drawback of this design is that you cannot filter your search by a range of dates or a list of cities. I would recommend adding the functionality of dropdown menus next to the input boxes to show the available filter options for each category. I would also recommend adding the ability to add more than one filter from each category. And in the dates category, I would add another input box so there are two dropdown calendars where a user can select a range of dates instead of just a single date.
